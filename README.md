## Cycling-strava-routes
Collect the cycling routes form strava

## What is this
This project is used to collect cycling routes, all of which are sourced from the Strava and have been uploaded to ThinkRider for virtual cycling.For Zwift users, please try using [What's on Zwift?](https://whatsonzwift.com/)

## Using Help
### For intelligent riding users
For users using ThinkRider, please adjust the "Resistance Sensitivity" in the settings before starting to ride.<br />
"Resistance sensitivity" is similar to the "Trainer Difficulty" setting in Zwift.<br />
The default value for this setting is 50% for Zwift, while 0% for ThinkRider, which means that the slope change will not be felt at all in ThinkRider.<br />
Therefore, ThinkRider users are requested to adjust the "resistance sensitivity" according to their own needs when starting the ride.

#### Is "resistance sensitivity" cheating?
The adjustable resistance sensitivity means that the resistance felt by the rider can be manually adjusted, but it is not a cheating switch.<br />
In fact, whether you adjust the resistance sensitivity to 0% or 100%, it will not affect the final result, only the resistance when you step on it.<br />
The software will combine your cycling data and resistance sensitivity data for processing, and finally calculate the correct data.<br />

#### How to set "resistance sensitivity"
On the Windows client, it is currently necessary to start cycling and make adjustments in the settings in the lower right corner of the interface.<br />
And every time you start a new ride, you need to set it, otherwise the default "resistance sensitivity" is 0%.
